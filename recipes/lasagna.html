    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made of layers of wide, flat pasta sheets, typically interspersed with rich fillings like meat sauce (often made with ground beef or pork and tomato), creamy b√©chamel sauce, and cheese (like ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan). It's baked in the oven until bubbly and golden on top, resulting in a hearty, comforting casserole-style meal. Variations include vegetarian versions with vegetables and marinara sauce or creative takes with different proteins and spices. It's a beloved comfort food around the world</p>
