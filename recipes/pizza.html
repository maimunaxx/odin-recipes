    <h2 class="heading2">Description</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">A Margherita pizza is a classic Italian pizza made with a thin, soft crust topped with simple ingredients: tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella cheese, fresh basil leaves, a drizzle of olive oil, and a pinch of salt. The colors of the toppings—red from the tomato, white from the mozzarella, and green from the basil—represent the Italian flag, making it both a delicious and patriotic dish. It's known for its fresh, vibrant flavors and is one of the most popular and traditional pizza styles.</p>
    <h2 class="heading2">Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>2 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 packet (2 ¼ teaspoons) active dry yeast</li>
        <li>¾ cup warm water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>½ cup tomato sauce (San Marzano tomatoes preferred)</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups fresh mozzarella (sliced)</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil (for drizzling)</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt (for seasoning)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="heading2">Instructions:</h2>
    <ol class="list">
        <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> Mix warm water, yeast, and sugar. Let it sit for 5–10 minutes until it foams. Add flour, salt, and olive oil, then knead into a smooth dough. Cover and let it rise for 1 hour.</li>
        <li><strong>Preheat Oven:</strong> Set your oven to 475°F (245°C) and place a pizza stone or baking sheet inside to heat up.</li>
        <li><strong>Roll Out the Dough:</strong> Once risen, roll out the dough into a 10–12 inch circle on a floured surface.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the Pizza:</strong> Spread the tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border. Arrange mozzarella slices on top.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Transfer the pizza onto the hot baking sheet or stone. Bake for 10–12 minutes until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Final Touches:</strong> Remove from the oven, top with fresh basil leaves, and drizzle with olive oil.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve & Enjoy!</strong> Let it cool for a minute, slice, and serve hot.</li>
